Tracking the spread of the coronavirus is the first step to its prevention.

This repository contains the code for tracking the following key indicators:
- Time-varying estimate of the effective reproduction number R(t)
- Daily confirmed cases
- Daily deaths attributed to COVID-19

The Notebook contains notes describing the method for estimating the effective reproduction number R(t).
